## CST 338 - SOFTWARE DESIGN
This repo contains the source files for our team projects (Team Cryptids). All projects are written in Java. The following projects were completed as part of this class:

 - **DecksOfCards:** Foundational classes required to create card games.
 - **BarcodeReader:** Reads a 2D array of binary data and transforms it into text (and vice versa).
 - **guiLowcardGame:** A GUI-based card game played against a computer. Players take turns putting cards down. The player with the lowest card gets a point.
 - **guiBuildGame:** A GUI-based card game played against a computer. Players take turns putting cards down in sequential order. Players incur penalty points if they cannot play a card. Implements the Model-View-Controller pattern and multi-threading.
